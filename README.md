🚀 Just Automated a Production-Grade AWS Infrastructure with Terraform!

After weeks of testing and optimization, I’ve built a secure, scalable AWS environment using Infrastructure-as-Code best practices. Here’s what makes this architecture special:

🔹 Multi-Tier Security:

Public subnets with Nginx reverse proxies (DDoS protection + SSL termination)

Private subnets for backend servers (isolated from direct internet access)

Fine-grained security groups following zero-trust principles

🔹 High Availability:

Cross-AZ deployment (us-east-1a/1b)

Auto-scaling groups behind Application Load Balancers

NAT Gateway for controlled outbound traffic

🧩 Architecture Components

🧩 Architecture Components

VPC Isolated AWS network environment.

Internet gateway(IGW) Connects VPC to the internet; enables

Public Subnets Host internet-facing resources (e.g., Bastion Host)

Private subnets Host internal resources like application servers

Route Tables Routes traffic appropriately (public → IGW, private → NAT Gateway)

NAT Gateway Allows private subnet instances outbound internet access securely

Elastic IP Static IP assigned to NAT Gateway for stable connectivity

Security Groups Virtual firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic

Nginx Instances Reverse proxy servers located in public subnets.Apache Backend InstancesWeb servers located in private subnets.Load BalancerDistributes incoming traffic for fault tolerance and high availability.

🔗 Key Features

Modular Design: All infrastructure components are organized into reusable modules

Variable-Driven: No hard-coded values, all configuration through variables

Remote Backend: State stored in S3 with locking via DynamoDB

Remote Exec: Automatic configuration of reverse proxies

Output Management: All server IPs saved to a local file

Complete Automation: All configuration done through Terraform
